If your current approach requires you to spend a lot of time and effort before you can validate your solution, the actual problem you should be solving is how to shorten your feedback loop.

customer satisfaction, product-market fit, ...</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ask yourself: \"What is the simplest incarnation of my idea that allows me to validate whether it will work?\"\n<ul>\n<li>Could be as simple as a sketch on a napkin</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Split big problems into small steps that allow you to verify that you're on the right track after each step</li>\n<li>Tackle risky or uncertain parts as early as possible</li>\n<li>Be proactive about asking for feedback\n<ul>\n<li>This can be as simple as announcing something you're about to do, which gives people a chance to stop you or suggest an alternative approach (this is usually also faster than asking and waiting for explicit permission)\n<ul>\n<li>\"Do whatever you want, but do it loudly\" (from <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/three-growth-strategies-for-individual-contributors-kv4q3zgt\">Three Growth Strategies for Individual Contributors</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Make sure

icon-link\" href=\"#architecture-design-and-code\"></a>Architecture, design and code</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If the problem you're solving requires a non-trivial approach, discuss it with a colleague before actually fully implementing it\n<ul>\n<li>You don't want to find out during code review that you need to throw most of your code away because your approach won't fit in with the rest of the system or you should have leveraged something that already existed</li>\n<li>Fifteen minutes of discussion can prevent days of wasted development effort</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Within the code itself, put checks as early as possible in the flow so your program doesn't do useless work</li>\n<li>When considering a new piece of technology, try to build a proof of concept with it that shows you if it performs well under the kind of load you foresee\n<ul>\n<li>This can also force you to consult the technology's documentation while creating the proof of concept, giving you an idea of how good that documentation is</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When building fault-tolerant systems, it can make sense to deliberately trigger faults at random, even up in production, so any problem with fault tolerance surfaces sooner rather than later\n<ul>\n<li>See also <a href=\"../architecture-design/Architectural-fitness-functions.md\">Architectural fitness functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2

energy by identifying, discussing and fixing these through code reviews</li>\n<li>See also <a href=\"../processes-techniques/Static-analysis.md\">Static analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fast automated tests can notify you of a bug in your code while you are in the middle of working on it, rather than having to switch contexts to fix it once the bug is found during code review or (even worse) after deployment</li>\n<li>Monitoring for errors on a shared dev environment can help to find bugs before they are deployed to production</li>\n<li>If requirements are unclear, clarify them with someone or make a quick small POC and validate that with someone</li>\n<li>New tools or processes: first set up something simple and check if the added value is what you expected it to be, only then invest in improving\n<ul>\n<li>Works a lot better than trying to set up something \"perfect\" immediately</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"tracer-bullets-and-prototypes\"><a
