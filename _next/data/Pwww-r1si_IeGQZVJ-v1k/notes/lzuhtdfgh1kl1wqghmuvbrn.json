In any case, getting proper rest and relaxation will put you in the best position to deal with whatever life decides to throw your way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Insecurity:</strong> The feeling that you aren't doing enough, looking bad in front of your manager and peers, ...\n<ul>\n<li>If this is the case, you are likely failing to see the actual value that you are bringing. You might also be setting unrealistic expectations for yourself. If you're really worried about your performance, ask your manager about it. See also <a href=\"../soft-skills/Expectation-management.md\">Expectation management</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Frustration:</strong> Feeling frustrated because you were not able to get done what you planned to get done\n<ul>\n<li>If this happened because something else came up, remind yourself that it's not realistic to expect yourself to finish the planned work as well. Additionally, the work you did instead might actually be very valuable. Sometimes, you can feel like you \"got nothing done\" when in reality you made a huge contribution to your team's success by mentoring people, clarifying requirements with stakeholders, planning future work, making sure team members are on the same page, ...</li>\n<li>If this happened because for whatever reason the work you planned to do is taking longer than expected, remind yourself that shit happens. After some proper rest and relaxation, you will also be in a better position to finish the work the next day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Guilt:</strong> Feeling guilty because you had an off day and couldn't get yourself to be productive\n<ul>\n<li>Often, an off day is caused by a lack of rest and relaxation. In this case, overworking out of guilt is the best way to guarantee that tomorrow will be an off day as well. Instead, get some much-needed rest to set yourself up for a more productive day tomorrow.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Obsession:</strong> Getting obsessed with a problem you're solving\n<ul>\n<li>Remind yourself that it's probably way more efficient to get some rest and continue tomorrow.
